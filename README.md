// Yehya
1)Motion with ESP and PID in rotations:
-Using Lcd setup and Lcd write functions to apply pwm values on motors according to ir readings
-controlling resolution and frequency of the pwm wave which help in changing the range of the speeds.
-using PID and IMU in right and left rotations and upgrade the setpoint in each rotation.
// Reem
2)PID and IMU:
-Using Yaw angle reading from IMU
-Passing Yaw to PID function and Explaining each term(Propotional:to decrease the error with constant value,derivative:to minimze the oscillations,Integral:to get rid of steady state error).
-Explain PID problem when the dt is not upgraded for period of time(robot was overshooting).

// Tamim
3)Shortest Path Algorithm
-Explain the main idea(LBL=F ,SBL=R ,ect....).
-Simplification of the path array (First trial).
-Second trial array(Reverse of the first one).
